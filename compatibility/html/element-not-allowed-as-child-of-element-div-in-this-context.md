It would seem that your `<div>` tag contains a element that is not allowed, as per the spec, to be a child of a `<div>`.

# How do I fix this ?

Re-organise your markup as to avoid this issue.

If not possible try updating the element to a different tag that would be allowed such as an `<span>` or it's friends.
