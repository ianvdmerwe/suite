The canonical link contains an error. This means the url given in the ```href``` attribute inside of the```<link rel="canonical"``` element has returned an error. The address is not valid and could not viewed unerringly.   

```
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Example Page</title>
    <link rel="canonical" href="validurl.com"/>
  </head>
</html>
```

# How do I fix this ?

Make sure there are no spelling mistakes in the url and that you can go to the given destination in your web browser. If your web server is set to redirect to a different url, make sure that the url that it redirects to is reachable from a web browser.
