The canonical link contains an error. This means the url given in the ```href``` attribute inside of the```<link rel="canonical"``` element has returned an error. The web address is not valid and could not viewed correctly.   

```
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Example Page</title>
    <link rel="canonical" href="validurl.com"/>
  </head>
</html>
```

# How do I fix this ?

Make sure there are no spelling mistakes in the url and that you can go view it in your web browser. If your web server is set to redirect to a different url, we expect a ```OK 200``` code from that web address.

#   

Which then has some paragraph text and possible code examples. All github flavored markdown supported.
Go as deep as you see fit !
