Canonical links are used to specify the preferred version of this web page. It is used to prevent duplicate content for search engines. They must be used within the `<head></head>` tags of your HTML5 document. 

```
<head>
	<link rel="canonical" href="http://domain.com/the-preferred-page.html"/>
</head>
```

# How do I fix this ?

Ensure that when you use canonical links they are inside the `<head></head>` tags. Otherwise they are rendered useless and search engines might not bestow enough love upon you.
