Document description tag should be between 20 and 300 characters. Meta descriptions don't have any length restrictions, but search engines usually truncate snippets longer than 160 characters. While meta descriptions are not important for search engine page rankings, they are important in gaining click throughs from a search engine results page.  

```
<head>
<meta name="description" content="This is an example of a meta description. This will often show up in search results.">
</head>
```
