Title tags `<title></title>` define the title of an HTML5 document. Title tags are important for user experience, social sharing and critical for SEO. They show up in the search engine SERPs (Search Engine Result Pages) and heavily influence whether users click through to your site. Title tags should be inside the document's `<head></head>` tags:

```
<head>
	<title>Main Keyword - Second Keyword | The site's brand</title>
</head>
```

# How do I fix this ?

Add unique page titles to every HTML5 document in your site. Keep them in between the `<head></head>` tags. It is recommended to use your two main keywords and then your site's brand in most cases. See the example above.
