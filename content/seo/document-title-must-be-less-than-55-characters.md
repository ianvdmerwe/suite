Your HTML5 document title defined in `<title></title>` tags will show up in SERPs (Search Engine Result Pages). If they are too long, they will be truncated and will not behave as you intended. They might be truncated missing out on important keywords but mostly they will just look weird and cause humans not to click on them.

If your titles are less than 55 characters it should display correctly in SERP's most of the time.

```
<head>
	<title>This title is far too long so it will be truncated looking rather strange so that no human would take it seriously in the search ingine result pages and even worse you might miss out on your keyword1 or keyword2</title>
</head>
```

# How do I fix this ?

Make sure that your titles do not exceed 55 characters. You might have to ease on your keyword use and keep only the most relevant. Use [Passmarked](http://passmarked.com) to check this for you :)
