Descriptions in HTML5 documents are like the Highlander, there may be only one. They are not like agent Smith, but more like Neo. According to W3C: `There must not be more than one meta element with its name attribute set to the value description per document.`

```
<head>
	<meta name="description" content="Some content of less than 160 characters that does a great job of describing your search engine listing"></title>
</head>
```

# How do I fix this ?

You will have to remove all but one of the `<meta name="description"></meta>` tags. Keep the one (or adjust it) that will describe your page best to a human so that they will click on it and use the right keywords so that robots like it too.
