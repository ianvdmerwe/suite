Minification refers to the process of removing unnecessary or redundant data without affecting how the resource is processed by the browser - e.g. code comments and formatting, removing unused code, using shorter variable and function names, and so on.

Unminified JavaScript and CSS wastes bandwidth and delays the rendering of a webpage.

# How do I fix this ?

Use a build tool (`npm`, `grunt` or `gulp`) to automate the minification of your production javascript and css (but also keep the development files in human readable format). Alternatively, command-line and online minifiers also exist.
