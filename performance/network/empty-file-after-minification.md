One or more of the javascript or css resources this page requires, contains only comments or empty lines. These files serve no purpose w.r.t the rendering of the page, and can thus be safely left out. This occasionally happens because certain theme files (e.g. WordPress or Joomla) are required by the CMS, but the developer chose to structure the resources differently.

# Why is this a problem ?

These requests still take up valuable bandwidth and processing power.

# How do I fix this ?

Remove these resources from your page if at all possible.
