Slow response times increase page abandonment with the average user only waiting 6-10 seconds before leaving a site. Response times of less than 1 second feels instantaneous to the user, while in the range of 1 second a user maintains his/her thought process. Anywhere from 6 seconds and longer, the user loses patience with the site and will abandon it.
