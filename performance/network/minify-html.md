Minification refers to the process of removing unnecessary or redundant data without affecting how the resource is processed by the browser - e.g. code comments and formatting, removing unused code, using shorter variable and function names, and so on.

Minified HTML helps reduce bandwidth usage and is more effective with Gzip. Minifying HTML removes whitespace, comments, non-required semicolons and hex code lengths. Gzip finds all repetitive strings and replaces them with a pointer to the first instance. Harnessing both of these features is an effective way of saving bandwidth usage.

# How do I fix this ?

Use a build tool (`npm`, `grunt` or `gulp`) to automate the minification of your production javascript and css (but also keep the development files in human readable format). Alternatively, command-line and online minifiers also exist.

When using template engines like Blade, Twig, Jade etc. be sure to look for builtin minification commands or packages that make this possible.
