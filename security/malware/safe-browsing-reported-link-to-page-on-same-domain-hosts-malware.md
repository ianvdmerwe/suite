# How do I fix this ?

Common ways to find malicious activity:

**Malicious scripts**

>Attackers will often inject scripts into the content of your web pages, `<script src="http://www.google-anaiytics.com/urchin,js"></script`, note the spelling. Other files like images and PDF's aren't safe from this attack either. Attackers may also use obfuscation to make it more difficult for antivirus software to detect.

**.htaccess redirects**

>Many hosting providers use the Apache web server, which uses a hidden server file called .htaccess. Attackers will sometimes modify this file to redirect users to harmful websites.

**Hidden iframes**

>An iframe is a section of a web page that loads content from another web site or page. Attackers will often use this method to inject malicious iframes into a web page. These iframes will be configured to not show on the web page, but still load it's content.
