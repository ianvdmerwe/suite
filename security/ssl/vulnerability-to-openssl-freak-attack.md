FREAK (Factoring RSA Export Keys) is an intentional weakness in the SSL and TLS cryptographic protocols for compliance with US cryptography export regulations. The regulations were put in place more than fifteen years ago to afford various security agencies, primarily the NSA, the ability to decrypt data transmissions encrypted with said weakened RSA keys. However, as the power of contemporary computers increased and the cost of cloud computing decreased, it became viable for persons and organisations other than US government agencies to decrypt data transmissions with weakened RSA keys.

# How do I fix this?

Use the Mozilla SSL Configuration Generator to update your SSL/TLS configuration for all of your virtual hosts. Ensure any and all TLS libraries used on your system are up to date. Unpatched versions of OpenSSL, Microsoft Schannel, and Apple SecureTransport are all vulnerable to FREAK.
