The POODLE attack is an exploit that relies on the presence of legacy security schemes for interoperability and backwards-compatibility.

# How do I fix this?

Prevention of the POODLE exploit is achieved by disabling SSL 3.0 for client and server. However, some older clients and servers do not support TLS 1.0 and above. Therefore, the browser and server implementation of TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV is recommended to make downgrade attacks impossible.
